## About Me

Dealing with massive accounting and financial data for the 17th years make me realize the importance of Data Science. Currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science, I believe the cross-functional skill set and expertise are required in order to become a Data Scientist. 

## Education
- **Master's Degree (Ongoing):** Data Science - Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)

- **Professional Qualification :** Management Accounting - Chartered Institute of Management Accounting (CIMA)

- **Professional Qualification :** International Public Sector Accounting Standard (IPSAS) - The Chartered Institute of Public Finance & Accountancy (CIPFA)
    
- **Bachelor's Degree:** Accountancy - University Utara Malaysia (UUM)

## Working Background

Engaged for almost 17 years in the field of accounting, finance, and auditing in various departments and government agencies, Audit Common Language (ACL) has been used to process and analyze the sampling of payroll and payment data to detect and prevent fraud and error. Needed technical expertise and too costly for ACL, looking forward to seeking additional data analytics tools and solutions like Phyton that could help identify and prevent fraud and error from data sampling.
