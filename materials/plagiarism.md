# Plagiarism Policy 🚫

Plagiarism is the act of copying or using someone else's work or ideas without proper citation or acknowledgment. Plagiarism is considered a serious academic offense and can result in penalties such as failing grades, suspension, or even expulsion. 😱

The plagiarism percentage for the report must be less than **20%**, while the AI plagiarism percentage must be **0%**.

To avoid plagiarism, you must give credit to the original sources of information, ideas, or words that you use in your project report. You can do this by using quotation marks, paraphrasing, summarizing, or citing the sources using a standard format such as APA, MLA, or Chicago. 📚

## Turnitin Report 📄👍

Turnitin is a web-based service that checks your project report for plagiarism and provides a Similarity Report that shows the percentage of matching text with other sources. Turnitin also uses artificial intelligence to detect potential plagiarism that is not based on text similarity, such as paraphrasing, translation, or synthesis. This is called the AI plagiarism percentage and it should be zero for your project report. 🧠

## Submission in Turnitin 📥

To submit your project report in Turnitin, you need to follow these steps:
1. Log in to Turnitin using the link [here](https://www.turnitin.com/login_page.asp)
2. Enter the Class ID: **42052721** and Enrollment Key: **mcds1123** for the **Big Data Management** class.

4. Select the **Assignment** you want to submit from the drop-down menu. Make sure you choose the correct one according to your project topic and group number. 
5. Click on the **Submit** button and upload your project report file. Use your **group name** as the file name, such as `Ass1_KicapSambal.pdf`. You only need to send the report. There is no need to submit source code *.ipynb.
6. Wait for the confirmation message and the digital receipt. You can also view your Similarity Report percentage by clicking on the **View** button.
7. You are allowed to resubmit your project report up to three times and get immediate feedback from Turnitin. After the third attempt, you will have to wait 24 hours before you can resubmit and get a new Similarity Report. ⏳

I hope this clarifies the submission process for your project. If you have any other questions, please let me know. 😊
