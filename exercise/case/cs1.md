# Case Study 1: Frustration and anger as AZ slots are all snapped up

**Registration is a failure, say disappointed Malaysians who took to social media over the poor user interface**

PETALING JAYA: Malaysians were left frustrated over the poor user interface for the AstraZeneca opt-in vaccine registration, which opened for the second time today for Malaysians aged below 60.

Despite the many problems, the million available slots were snapped up in less than an hour.

Stay up-to-date by following FMT's Telegram channel
According to the Covid-19 vaccine supply access guarantee special committee (JKJAV) website, registrations have now closed after being open at 12.15 pm.

However, the second round of registrations left many Malaysians frustrated, angry and confused over what has been described as ‚Äúincompetent‚Äù programming.

Many have taken to Twitter to complain about several website glitches, such as being unable to view the vaccine distribution centres despite refreshing the website multiple times.

Netizens also complained of being forced to enter and re-enter details for over an hour only to be blocked from submitting their applications.

Some also noted the RM70 million budget announced to run the website.

One user Anusha Rym tweeted: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me to bersabar (be patient) if you don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to have multiple family members depending on you to register for the vaccine because they are illiterate. This is ******* stressful and Malaysians deserve better @JKJAVMY @Khairykj.‚Äù

Anusha told FMT she was attempting to register a total of five family members, who were all in their 50s.

She said her two uncles work in the construction sector, and another was a handyman. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important that they get vaccinated,‚Äù she said.

Another user who was trying to register for his mother said: ‚ÄúI had my developer tool open to see what‚Äôs going on. The way they built it is not worth RM70 million. Many basic mistakes I wouldn‚Äôt make.‚Äù

User Jeff Sandhu also tweeted on the various system failures, saying it was being run on free cloud apps.

‚ÄúThe codes are such a mess. Please @JKJAVMY @Khairykj , don‚Äôt do this to us. Give it to someone with a great record of building these platforms. RM70 million is a joke, a bad one. #AstraZenaca #CucukMYAZ.‚Äù

Vaccine registrations for the AstraZeneca opt-in programme opened on May 23 for Malaysians above 60 in Johor, Selangor, Penang, Kuala Lumpur and Sarawak.

Vaccine minister Khairy Jamaluddin said 228,000 senior citizens had signed up for the prioritised vaccine slots.

Over a million doses of the vaccine were procured for this round of the opt-in programme.

Meanwhile, MUDA secretary-general Amir Abd Hadi urged Khairy to clarify who was awarded the contract to develop the registration site.

He pointed out that many people were questioning why the site was facing issues, despite costing around RM70 million to develop.

‚ÄúAfter several times, the website has failed to meet the standards and make it easier for people to register for the vaccine,‚Äù he said, adding that the public had also discovered that the site was run using a free version of Cloudflare.

## Questions
Questions related to big data management based on the case study are:

- What are the benefits and challenges of using big data to manage the vaccine registration process?
- What are the common tools and frameworks for developing and deploying a user-friendly and reliable website for vaccine registration, such as web servers, databases, cloud services, etc.?
- How can big data integration and data quality be ensured when collecting and storing the vaccine registration data from various sources, such as online forms, mobile apps, etc.?
- How can big data analytics and visualization be used to monitor and evaluate the vaccine registration process, such as the number of slots, the distribution of vaccines, the feedback from users, etc.?
- How can big data security and privacy be protected when handling the vaccine registration data, such as encrypting, anonymizing, and complying with data policies and regulations?
- How can big data scalability and performance be improved when dealing with the high volume and velocity of the vaccine registration data, such as using parallel and distributed computing, load balancing, caching, etc.?
- How can big data testing and debugging be conducted to identify and resolve the errors and glitches in the vaccine registration website, such as using automated testing tools, logging and tracing, etc.?
- How can big data governance and management be established to oversee and coordinate the vaccine registration process, such as defining roles and responsibilities, setting standards and guidelines, etc.?
- How can big data collaboration and communication be facilitated among the stakeholders involved in the vaccine registration process, such as the government, the vaccine providers, the developers, the users, etc.?
- How can big data innovation and learning be fostered to enhance and optimize the vaccine registration process, such as using machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc.?.
