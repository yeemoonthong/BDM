# Case Study 3: COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Introduction

COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has affected millions of people and caused significant social and economic impacts. The analysis of COVID-19 data, such as cases, deaths, tests, vaccines, variants, etc., is crucial for understanding the spread and severity of the disease, as well as the effectiveness of the interventions and policies. However, COVID-19 data analysis poses many challenges, such as:

- The data is large and complex, involving multiple sources, formats, and dimensions.
- The data is dynamic and evolving, requiring frequent updates and revisions.
- The data is noisy and incomplete, containing errors, outliers, and missing values.
- The data is heterogeneous and diverse, reflecting different geographic, demographic, and epidemiological factors.

To address these challenges, high performance data processing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) are essential. High performance data processing is the process of analyzing large and complex data sets using advanced techniques and tools. EDA is a subfield of data processing that focuses on discovering patterns, trends, and outliers in the data, often using visual methods. EDA can help to generate hypotheses, identify data quality issues, and guide further analysis.

In this case study, we will demonstrate how high performance data processing and EDA can be applied to COVID-19 data analysis, using a cloud-based platform and various tools and frameworks. We will also discuss the benefits and challenges of using cloud computing for data processing and EDA, as well as the ethical and social implications of COVID-19 data analysis.

## Data Sources and Cloud Platform

The COVID-19 data that we will use for this case study comes from two main sources:

- The COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) , which provides daily updated data on confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases at the global, country, and subnational levels.
- The Our World in Data (OWID) COVID-19 dataset , which provides daily updated data on testing, vaccination, hospitalization, and other indicators at the global and country levels.

Both sources provide the data in CSV format, which can be easily downloaded and processed. However, the data is also large and complex, involving millions of records and hundreds of variables. Therefore, we need a high performance data processing platform that can handle the data efficiently and scalably.

For this case study, we will use the Google Cloud Platform (GCP)  as our cloud-based platform for data processing and EDA. GCP is a suite of cloud services that provides various solutions for data storage, processing, analysis, and visualization. GCP offers many benefits for data processing and EDA, such as:

- Scalability: GCP can scale up or down the resources (such as CPU, memory, disk, etc.) according to the data size and complexity, ensuring optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.
- Flexibility: GCP can support various data formats, sources, and destinations, allowing seamless integration and transformation of the data.
- Reliability: GCP can ensure high availability and durability of the data, as well as backup and recovery options in case of failures or disasters.
- Security: GCP can protect the data from unauthorized access and malicious attacks, using encryption, authentication, and authorization mechanisms.
- Collaboration: GCP can enable collaboration and sharing of the data and results among multiple users and teams, using cloud-based tools and frameworks.

However, GCP also poses some challenges for data processing and EDA, such as:

- Complexity: GCP can be complex and overwhelming for beginners, requiring familiarity with the concepts, terminologies, and architectures of cloud computing, as well as the specific features and functionalities of GCP services and tools.
- Compatibility: GCP can have compatibility issues with some existing tools and frameworks, requiring adaptation or migration of the code and data.
- Privacy: GCP can raise privacy concerns, as the data is stored and processed in remote servers that may be subject to different laws and regulations, as well as potential breaches or leaks.

## Data Processing and EDA Tools and Frameworks

To perform data processing and EDA on GCP, we will use various tools and frameworks that are compatible and integrated with GCP services. The main tools and frameworks that we will use are:

- Google Cloud Storage (GCS) : GCS is a service that provides scalable and durable object storage for any type of data. We will use GCS to store the raw and processed COVID-19 data in CSV format, as well as the intermediate and final results of the data processing and EDA.
- Google Cloud Dataproc (GCD) : GCD is a service that provides managed clusters of virtual machines (VMs) that can run Apache Spark  and Apache Hadoop  applications. Spark and Hadoop are open-source frameworks that enable distributed and parallel processing of large-scale data, using various libraries and modules for data ingestion, transformation, analysis, and output. We will use GCD to create and manage Spark and Hadoop clusters, and run Spark applications for data processing and EDA on the COVID-19 data.
- Google Colaboratory (Colab) : Colab is a cloud-based notebook environment that allows users to write and execute Python code, as well as interact with the data and results using text, images, charts, etc. Colab is integrated with GCP and can access GCS and GCD resources, as well as other GCP services and tools. We will use Colab to write and run Python code for data processing and EDA on the COVID-19 data, using various libraries and packages, such as pandas , numpy , matplotlib , seaborn , etc. Pandas is a library that provides high-performance data structures and operations for manipulating and analyzing tabular data. Numpy is a library that provides efficient numerical computation and linear algebra operations for multidimensional arrays. Matplotlib and seaborn are libraries that provide various data visualization techniques, such as charts, graphs, maps, etc.
- Google Data Studio (GDS) : GDS is a service that provides interactive and customizable dashboards and reports for data visualization and exploration. GDS can connect to various data sources, such as GCS, GCD, and other GCP services and tools, as well as external sources, such as CSV files, databases, etc. We will use GDS to create and share dashboards and reports for COVID-19 data analysis, using various widgets and features, such as charts, tables, filters, etc.

## Data Processing and EDA Workflow

The workflow for data processing and EDA on the COVID-19 data using GCP and the tools and frameworks mentioned above is as follows:

- Data Ingestion: We will download the COVID-19 data from the JHU and OWID sources in CSV format, and upload them to GCS buckets, using the GCS web console or the gsutil command-line tool . We will also create a GCD cluster, using the GCD web console or the gcloud command-line tool , and configure it to access the GCS buckets and run Spark applications.
- Data Transformation: We will write and run Spark applications on the GCD cluster, using Colab notebooks and the PySpark API , to transform the COVID-19 data from CSV format to Spark DataFrames , which are distributed and resilient data structures that can be manipulated and analyzed using various operations and functions. We will also perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation tasks, such as:

    - Merging and joining the JHU and OWID data sets based on common keys, such as date and country.
    - Filtering and selecting the relevant variables and records for the data analysis, such as cases, deaths, tests, vaccines, etc.
    - Handling missing values, outliers, and errors in the data, using various strategies, such as imputation, interpolation, deletion, etc.
    - Creating new variables and features from the existing ones, such as calculating the case fatality rate, the vaccination coverage, the reproduction number, etc.
    - Aggregating and summarizing the data at different levels of granularity, such as global, regional, country, etc.

- Data Analysis: We will write and run Python code on Colab notebooks, using various libraries and packages, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc., to perform data analysis on the COVID-19 data, such as:

    - Exploring the descriptive statistics and distributions of the variables and features, such as mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, etc.
    - Visualizing the trends and patterns of the variables and features over time and space, using various charts, graphs, maps, etc.
    - Comparing and contrasting the variables and features across different groups and categories, such as regions, countries, income levels, etc.
    - Correlating and associating the variables and features with each other, using various measures and tests, such as Pearson, Spearman, Chi-square, etc.
    - Hypothesizing and testing the causal relationships and effects of the variables and features, using various methods and models, such as regression, ANOVA, etc.

- Data Output: We will write and run Spark applications on the GCD cluster, using Colab notebooks and the PySpark API, to output the results of the data processing and EDA to GCS buckets, in CSV or other formats, for further use or sharing. \
